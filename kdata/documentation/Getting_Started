    Vagbond is a quick way to set up virtual environments composed of one or
    more virtual machines. The idea is to enable users to quickly set up
    sandboxed environments for development and production
    purposes. The <a href="/documentation/vagabond/Project_Summary">Vagabond
    project summary page</a> details a number of
    typical <a href="/documentation/vagabond/Project_Summary#Common-Use-Cases">common
    use cases</a>. You may also want to review
    the <a href="/documentation/vagabond/Primer#Terminology">terminology section in the

    At this time, we support all versions of Mac and Linux which support
    recent versions of Vagrant (1.2+), VirtualBox (4.1+), and git (1.7+,
    though earlier probably good too). In theroy everything should work on
    Windows though we are not currently testing this
    ourselves.<span class="note">Windows support will be included in 1.0. In
    the meantime, any feedback would be appreciated.</span>

    Before jumping into Vagabond proper, you will need to set up three pieces of
    software: 
    <a href="www.virtualbox.org">Virtual Box</a>,
    <a href="www.vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a>,
    and <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>. If already installed, please
    check the versions are reasonable up to date with those quoted below.
  </div>
  <div class="subHeader"><span>Vagrant</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    At the time of writing, the latest version of Vagrant was 1.2.2 (the 1.2.x
    series is also referrevd to as 'version 2'), but you should start with the
    latest available version, which you
    can <a href="http://downloads.vagrantup.com/">download here</a>. After
    selecting the version, select the installer for your particular operating
    system. Linux users may want to check if Vagrant comes pre-packaged with
    their distribution.
  </div>
  <div class="subHeader"><span>VirtualBox</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    Same goes for VirtualBox, which you
    can <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">download
    here</a>. Download the latest available version for your operating system,
    and again, Linux users will want to check if VirtualBox is available as
    part of the distro. We have used 4.1.x and 4.2.x.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    It shouldn't cause any problems, but you may want to take a look at the
    <a href="#VirtualBox-Guest-Additions">VirtualBox guest additions</a> note
    below in the <a href="#Troubleshooting">troubleshooting section</a>.
  </div>
  <div class="subHeader"><span>git</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    As far as we're concerned at this point, git is used to install and update
    Vagabond. <span data-perspective="detailed">Git is more broadly a piece of
    software used to track and distribute code changes. Because Vagabond is
    relatively simple, it's really only necessary to get a copy of the latest
    configuration scripts, and that's what git does. </span> Almost all Linux
    users should find git in their distro. Mac and Windows users
    can <a href="http://git-scm.com/download">download the git
    installer</a>. Mac users may also consider
    the <a href="https://help.github.com/articels/set-up-git">GitHub GUI</a>,
    which will also install the basic git tools.<span class="note">One note:
    the GitHub GUI may want to install the command line tools in a different
    location than the git installer from <code>git-scm.com</code>. This
    doesn't seem to cause any issues in our own testing, though it's not
    ideal. So, if you think you might use the GitHub GUI, we recommend you let
    it install the command line tools and avoid installing
    from <code>git-scm.com</code>.</span>

  <div class="p">
    One note with VirtualBox: the 'guest additions', which are installed on
    the guest, allow the guest and host to share files and perform other
    tricks. Every version of the VirtualBox application is paired with a
    specific version of guest additions and you'll probably see a warning
    about the versions not matching. In practice, the guest additions are
    compatible enough and everything should work fine. We do intend to
    automate the update of guest additions in the
    future.<span class="note">There was a <a href="
    http://blog.csanchez.org/2012/05/03/automatically-download-and-install-virtualbox-guest-additions-in-vagrant/">plugin</a>
    for Vagrant v1, and in theory the process should be relatively easy to
    automate with a shell script. It's on the TODO list.</span>
