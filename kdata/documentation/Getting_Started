    Vagbond is a quick way to set up virtual environments composed of one or
    more virtual machines. The idea is to enable users to quickly set up
    sandboxed environments for development and production
    purposes. The <a href="/documentation/vagabond/Project_Summary">Vagabond
    project summary page</a> details a number of
    typical <a href="/documentation/vagabond/Project_Summary#Common-Use-Cases">common
    use cases</a>. You may also want to review
    the <a href="/documentation/vagabond/Primer#Terminology">terminology section in the

    At this time, we support all versions of Mac and Linux which support
    recent versions of Vagrant (1.2+), VirtualBox (4.1+), and git (1.7+,
    though earlier probably good too). In theroy everything should work on
    Windows though we are not currently testing this
    ourselves.<span class="note">Windows support will be included in 1.0. In
    the meantime, any feedback would be appreciated.</span>

    Before jumping into Vagabond proper, you will need to set up some
    software. Everyone will need <a href="www.virtualbox.org">Virtual Box</a>,
    <a href="www.vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a>,
    and <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>. If you have problems, you may
    want to check some of the version notes below, especilly as regards VirtualBox.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    That's it for Linux/BSD users. Mac and windows will need to install
    an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System">X Window
    </a> client. We
    recommend <a href="http://xquartz.macforge.org/landing/">XQuartz</a>
    and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xming">Xming</a>
    respectively&mdash;only because that's what we use. We've done no
    comparisons.
  </div>
  <div class="subHeader"><span>Vagrant</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    <a href="http://downloads.vagrantup.com/">Download</a> the latest version
    of Vagrant for your operating system. We tested against 1.2.2 on Mac and Linux. FYI: the Vagrant
    docs sometimes refer to the 1.2.x series as 'version 2'. Linux users
    should check if their distro provides a package from the 1.2.x series.
  </div>
  <div class="subHeader"><span>VirtualBox</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">Download</a> the
    latest version of VirtualBox for your operating system. A relatively
    recent version is probably available to Linux users via their distro
    package manager. We have used 4.1.x and 4.2.x. Desktop users will also
    need to install the VirtualBox extensions pack. Unfortunately, VirtualBox
    releases are geared towards developers more than users, and they do
    release versions with bugs. If you have problems, you may want to
    downgrade to the last known good version for all supported platforms:
    4.2.12.<span class="note">The 4.2.14 release in particular would fail
    cryptically when attempting to initialize a new VM with <code>vagrant
    up</code>; something was broken in the import on Mac 10.8 for some large
    subset of users. There have been issues in the past with permissions on
    both Mac and Windows. A couple serious release issues per year does not
    seem uncommon.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    It shouldn't cause any problems, but you may want to take a look at the
    <a href="#VirtualBox-Guest-Additions">VirtualBox guest additions</a> note
    below in the <a href="#Troubleshooting">troubleshooting section</a>.
  </div>
  <div class="subHeader"><span>git</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    As far as we're concerned at this point, git is used to install and update
    Vagabond. <span data-perspective="detailed">Git is more broadly a piece of
    software used to track and distribute code changes. Because Vagabond is
    relatively simple, it's really only necessary to get a copy of the latest
    configuration scripts, and that's what git does. </span> Almost all Linux
    users should find git in their distro. Mac and Windows users
    can <a href="http://git-scm.com/download">download the git
    installer</a>. Mac users may also consider
    the <a href="https://help.github.com/articels/set-up-git">GitHub GUI</a>,
    which will also install the basic git tools.<span class="note">One note:
    the GitHub GUI may want to install the command line tools in a different
    location than the git installer from <code>git-scm.com</code>. This
    doesn't seem to cause any issues in our own testing, though it's not
    ideal. So, if you think you might use the GitHub GUI, we recommend you let
    it install the command line tools and avoid installing
    from <code>git-scm.com</code>.</span>

  <div class="p">
    To install Vagabond, most users will want to download a TAR of the latest
    release. Vagabond can also be run from a git clone, making extending and
    customizing your own version relatively simple. Until general release,
    however, we do not recommend this method for non-Vagabond
    contributors. 3rd parties will want to wait till the product fully
    stabalizes.

  <div class="p">
    One note with VirtualBox: the 'guest additions', which are installed on
    the guest, allow the guest and host to share files and perform other
    tricks. Every version of the VirtualBox application is paired with a
    specific version of guest additions and you'll probably see a warning
    about the versions not matching. In practice, the guest additions are
    compatible enough and everything should work fine. We do intend to
    automate the update of guest additions in the
    future.<span class="note">There was a <a href="
    http://blog.csanchez.org/2012/05/03/automatically-download-and-install-virtualbox-guest-additions-in-vagrant/">plugin</a>
    for Vagrant v1, and in theory the process should be relatively easy to
    automate with a shell script. It's on the TODO list.</span>
