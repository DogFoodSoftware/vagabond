    Vagabond's purpose, experessed in technical terms, is to reliably create
    environment runtimes for production and organize the runtimes in a way
    that's "relatively" easy to manage (when compared with other "best
    avaliable" competitors). Within the context of Vagabond, The twin goals
    are referred to as 'reliability' and 'evolvability'. Reliability broadly
    means the ability of the system to perform advertized services without the
    need for human involvement. The second goal is to model the necessary
    functions in a way that is most advantageous to improving all other system
    metrics. It's a classic "first do no harm"... and then do as much good as
    possible directive.
