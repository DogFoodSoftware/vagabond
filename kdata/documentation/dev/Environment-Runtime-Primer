    An 'environment runtime' is what Vagabond creates. 'Environment runtimes'
    are concretely collections of running machines (both physical and
    virtual) organized for some conceptual purpose, like a company's public
    website or developers test environment.

  <div class="subHeader"><span>Environment Boundaries and Interactions</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    It is generally useful (at this point) to think of environments as
    islands, with the possibility of trade. Environments may be
    self-controlled, or cooridinated / commanded by some external entity. In
    either case, the environment fundamentally a peer in in the graph. It is
    the necessary conduit of information and interaction and&mdash;when
    properly functioning&mdash;can control all it's borders perfectly.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    Each island-environment is able to negotiate contracts with every other
    island-environment (akin to setting up point-to-point trade routes in a
    classically liberal universal market). Each environment may specifically:
    <ul>
      <li>delegate service fulfillment via a <em>service contract</em>,</li>,
      <li>take conditional control of foreign bits via a <em>storage
      contract</em>, or</li>
      <li>share semi-private information (ostensibly for the purpose of
      maintaining security privileges) under a <em>audit contract</em>.</li>
    </ul>

  <div class="subHeader"><span>Environment Sizing</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    If we think of any non-trivial economic actor&mdash;a company or
    person&mdash;and look at everything they do, there's always quite a bit
    going on. For instance, even a small comany&mdash;or a single person
    operation&mdash;has strictly internal documents, code, designs, plans, or
    whatever. Stuff their working on or don't want out there. They have a
    public facing side, with all the stuff they want to communicate to the
    world. Then there's the friends and familly stuff... like bank account
    numbers or sexy pictures.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    You could service all three 'zones' with a single enviromnent that was
    internally zone aware. Or, you could set up three environments that each
    served a single zone. There are pros and cons to each approach, an this
    question of balancing a 'many simple' vs. ' a few integrated' environments
    is what we mean by 'environment sizing'.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    For the most part, we've tried to design Vagabond to be neutral on this
    question of "proper" environment sizing. This neutrality is pragmatic, not
    doctrinal, meaning Vagabond may evolve or discover preferences on this
    point in the future.
