    An 'environment runtime' is what Vagabond creates. 'Environment runtimes'
    are concretely collections of running machines (both physical and
    virtual) organized for some conceptual purpose, like a company's public
    website or developers test environment.

    If we think of any non-trivial economic actor&mdash;a company or
    person&mdash;and look at everything they do, there's always quite a bit
    going on. For instance, even a small comany&mdash;or a single person
    operation&mdash;has strictly internal documents, code, designs, plans, or
    whatever. Stuff their working on or don't want out there. They have a
    public facing side, with all the stuff they want to communicate to the
    world. Then there's the friends and familly stuff... like bank account
    numbers or sexy pictures.

    You could service all three 'zones' with a single enviromnent that was
    internally zone aware. Or, you could set up three environments that each
    served a single zone. There are pros and cons to each approach, an this
    question of balancing a 'many simple' vs. ' a few integrated' environments
    is what we mean by 'environment sizing'.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    For the most part, we've tried to design Vagabond to be neutral on this
    question of "proper" environment sizing. This neutrality is pragmatic, not
    doctrinal, meaning Vagabond may evolve or discover preferences on this
    point in the future.
