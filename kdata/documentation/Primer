Meta-Configuration

Meta-configuration describes the conceptual environment setup. 'Requires a
static IP' is a common meta-configuration for many hosts in a production
environment.

Configuration is done with a Vagabondfile in the environment.


Configuration

Configuration is done by consuming the meta-configuration, analyzing the
environment context, and possibly interacting with an external operator to
nail down the specifics necessary for creating a runnable environment. E.g.,
if the meta-configuration requires a static IP address, the configuration
process will determine the actual IP address to use and generate configuration
files specifying the address.

Configuration is accomplished with a Vagrantfile in the environment.
