vagabond
========

Vagabond does two things. First, it adds a REST-ful API on top of Vagrant virtual host management. The REST work with the Conveyor command line tool as well. (TODO: link)

Second, Vagabond implements support for hooking virtual machine setups into GitHub (and potentially other) issues. The primary use is to have automated agents prepare appropriate development enironments necessary to work on issues.
