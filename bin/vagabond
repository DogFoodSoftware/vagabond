# * Vagabondn CLI client. We <span data-todo="Link to Conveyor CLI

# * support</a> within the <a
# * href="/documentation/kibbles/ref/Common-Interface-Standard">Conveyor

# * current special purpose processor so as to have a similar
# * structure and interface as we believe the common CLI will have,
# * however there are likely to be unsupported changes.

# * <div class="p">
# * The general form of the vagabond CLI command is: <pre><code>
# * vagabond <resource> <action> [<item ID>] [<name1>=<val1>...]
# * </code></pre> where '<code>resource</code>' may be:
# * <code>boxes</code>, <code>environment</code>, or
# * <code>template</code>. The resource names may be preceeded by
# * '<code>vagabond-</code>', which would actually be the canonical
# * name, the shorter versions being provided for user
# * convenience. The'<code>action</code>' may be
# * <code>POST|CREATE</code>, <code>GET</code>,
# * <code>PUT|UPDATE</code>, or <code>DELETE|REMOVE</code>. The
# * acceapted parameters are dependent on the other arguments and
# * defined with respect to each action.

# * The Vagabond projet provides three resource:
# * <ul>
# * <li><code>v√•agabond-templates</code>: the univers<e of environment
# * templates.  Each temeplate consists of one or more machine
# * templates. A machine template is a high level (meta) description
# * of what a running machine instance would look like<span
# * data-perspective="coding detailed">; embodied in
# * <code>Vagabondfile</code></span>.</li>
# * <li><code>vagabond-environments</code>: the universe of runnable
# * environment configurations. Each environment configuration
# * consists of one or more machine configurations. Each machine
# * configuration is associated to a single virtual machine instance
# * (which may or may not be created or running).</li>
# * <li><code>vagabond-boxes</code>: the universe of canned virtual
# * machine images. An image is used<span data-perspective="coding
# * operations"> by the underlying Vagrant service</span> along with
# * an environment machine configuration<span data-perspective="coding
# * detailed"> (encoded within a <code>Vagrantfile</code>) </span> to
# * create each running virtual machine instance.</li>
# * </ul>
# * </div>
# * <div class="subHeader"><span><code>vagabond-templates</code></span></div>
# * <div class="p">
# * Each <code>vagabond-templates</code> item is composed of a set of
# * one or more <code>Vagabondfile</code>s and 0+ artifact files. Each
# * <code>Vagabondfile</code> and associated artificats are used to
# * create usable configurations within a
# * <code>vagrant-environments</code> item.
# * </div>
# * <div class="p">
# * Each environment template describes a single environment
# * type.<span data-perspective="coding"> The environment type is
# * analogous to an object class or object tempalte; the environment
# * instance corresponding with an object instance.</span> There is no
# * hard and fast rule how environments are to releate to running
# * machines. You could, for instance, use single environment for each
# * machine, or you could organize environmnts by department or other
# * high level abstraction, or use a single environment for your
# * entire operation. In practice we recommend most users refer to the
# * <a
# * href="/documentation/vagabon/ref/Environment-Design-Guidelines">Vagabond
# * Environment Design Guidelines</a>.
# * </div>
# * <div class="p">
# * Within an environment, machine-type templates may be organized
# * under any number of groupings (laid out on disk as
# * directories). Each directory may exclusively contain one or more
# * directories or a machine template file set. The environment root
# * directory may only contain directories.
# * </div>
# * <div class="p">
# * Templates are stored in a seperate directory as <a
# * href="/documentation/kibbles/lexicon/Static_Data">static data</a>.
# * Currently, Vagabond only supports the standard templates
# * distributed with the Vagabond distribution. The 1.0-GA release
# * will support loadable templates, allowing Vagabond to integrate
# * and be integrated with other projects.
#* </div>

# * <div class="subHeader"><span><code>vagabond-environments</code></span></div>
# * <div class="p">
# * Whereas a <code>vagabond-templates</code> item describes a
# * meta-environment, a <code>code-environment</code> item relates to
# * a runnable environment. Environments exist as <a
# * href="/documentation/kibbles/lexicon/Runtime-Data</a>runtime
# * data</a>. Any given machine template (corresponding to a
# * <code>Vagabondfile</code>) from a <code>vagabond-templates</code>
# * item may be used to initiate zero or more machine instances in a
# * given <code>vagabond-environment</code> item.
