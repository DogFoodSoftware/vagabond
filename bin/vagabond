# * The general form of the vagabond CLI command is: <pre><code>
# * vagabond <resource> <action> [<item ID>] [<name1>=<val1>...]
# * </code></pre> where '<code>resource</code>' may be:
# * <code>boxes</code>, <code>environment</code>, or
# * <code>template</code>. The resource names may be preceeded by
# * '<code>vagabond-</code>', which would actually be the canonical
# * name, the shorter versions being provided for user
# * convenience. The'<code>action</code>' may be
# * <code>POST|CREATE</code>, <code>GET</code>,
# * <code>PUT|UPDATE</code>, or <code>DELETE|REMOVE</code>. The
# * acceapted parameters are dependent on the other arguments and
# * defined with respect to each action.
