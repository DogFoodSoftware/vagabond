  <div class="p">
    A quick rundown on terminology. A <em>virtual machine</em> is a computer
    just like any other except that instead of a physical box, it runs inside
    another computer. The physical computer is called the <em>host</em> and
    the virtual machine is called the <em>guest</em>.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    The host uses a <em>virtualizer</em>, like VirtualBox, to run the host
    machine. The virtualizer emulates real hardware so as far as the guest is
    concerned, it's running an real hardware like any other computer.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    Vagrant is a application which is used to manage and configure
    guests. Vagrant calls the guests it creates <em>vagrants</em>. Vagabond
    pre-packages Vagrant configurations and setups for specific purposes, like
    a web server or a development workstation. Vagabond generally deals
    with <em>environments</em> which consist of one or more guests. For
    instance, a particular environment may set up a separate web server and
    database server packaged in a single Vagabond
    environment.

  <div class="p">
    <span style="color: red">Be aware:</span> This section of documentation is
    ahead of current implementation. We do not yet
    use <code>Vagabondfile</code> as described here.
  </div>
  <div class="subHeader"><span>Meta-Configuration</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    Meta-configuration describes the conceptual environment setup. 'Requires a
    static IP' is a common meta-configuration for many hosts in a production
    environment. Meta-configuration is described by
    the <code>Vagabondfile</code>.
  </div>
  <div class="subHeader"><span>Configuration</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    Configuration is done by consuming the meta-configuration, analyzing the
    environment context, and possibly interacting with an external operator to
    nail down the specifics necessary for creating a runnable
    environment. E.g., if the meta-configuration requires a static IP address,
    the configuration process will determine the actual IP address to use and
    generate configuration files specifying the address. Configuration is
    encoded in <code>Vagrantfile</code>s.
