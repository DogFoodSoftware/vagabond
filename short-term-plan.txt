== General Goal ==

Set up a rudimentary environment. Specifically, two router / DNS +
webserver.

Technecilly, enable 'con environments create <ENV NAME> <TEMPLATE BASE>'

== Steps ==

*) Grab '<TEMPLATE BASE>/Vagrantfile.env-base-box', copy to
   '~/playground/vagabond/data/environments/<ENV NAME>/tmp-bootstrap-box'
*) Run 'vagrant up' to initialize base box.
*) Use vagrant to create environment base box.
*) Delete the temporary bootstrap box base.
*) Grab '<TEMPLATE BASE>/Vagrantfile.env-controller', copy to
  '~/playground/vagabond/data/environments/<ENV NAME>/eco-controller-1.<ENV NAME>'
*) Initialiez eco-controller-1.<ENV NAME>
*) Grab '<TEMPLATE BASE>/Vagrantfile.env-controller', copy to
  '~/playground/vagabond/data/environments/<ENV NAME>/eco-controller-2.<ENV NAME>'
*) Initialiez eco-controller-2.<ENV NAME>
*) Configure 'eco-controller-<HOSTNAME>.<ENV BAME>' and
 eco-controler-(1|2).<ENV NAME>' in both servers. Both are masters.

== Eco Controller Setup ==

*) Configure eco-controllers as routers for private network.
*) Generate 16 character random string password for initial
   access. Report to user on CLI.
*) Generate self signed web cert. Report fingerprint to user on CLI.
*) Setup controller web services with SSL and HTTP basic access using
   admin/<generated password>

Now have rudimentary setup necessary to setup additional serves. First
up, is a web server.

== Single Web Server Setup ==

*) Specify public IP and DNS names.
*) Setup entries in the DNS servers.
*) Setup routing from eco-controllers to web server.
*) Bind controllors to public IP.
*) Setup configuration for web server (document base from git repository).
